      "description": "In our production, we prioritize quality. We produce eco-friendly candles and aromatic diffusers. What does this mean? We do not use paraffin like some brands in the mass market. Paraffin is not a natural material; candles made from it release byproducts of petroleum refining during the burning process. Moreover, paraffin burns 3-5 times shorter compared to natural wax. We use natural wax made from soy and coconut."
