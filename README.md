# Liquined - Online Shop for Handmade Soy Candles

Welcome to Liquined, an online shop that brings together European art, sculpture, and home decor through our unique collection of handmade soy candles. Our mission is to create candles that not only illuminate your space but also fill it with dreaminess and artistic beauty.

## Description

Liquined is the result of a passion for combining European art and sculpture with home decor. We believe that candles have the power to transform any room into a dreamy and enchanting space. With our expertise and collaboration with talented local Israeli artists, we have spent months studying and refining the handmade candle making process to create one-of-a-kind Liquined candles.

In our production, we prioritize quality and sustainability. We specialize in producing eco-friendly candles and aroma diffusers. Unlike some brands in the mass market, we do not use paraffin in our candles. Paraffin is not a natural raw material and emits oil products during the combustion process. Instead, we use natural soy and coconut wax, which are environmentally friendly alternatives. These natural waxes offer longer burning times, outperforming paraffin by 3-5 times.
